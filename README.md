# 2D-nanofluidics-memristors

Contains examples of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation codes for the article "Principles of Hodgkin-Huxley iontronics with two-dimensional nanofluidic memristors"
by P Robin, N Kavokine and L Bocquet (LPENS, ENS-PSL, Paris, France).

allatomMD contains information relative to all-atom simulations (with explicit solvent and confining material -- in other words, classical MD)
brownian_dynamics contains information relative to Brownian dynamics simulations (implicit solvent and confining material)
neuron contains information relative to Brownian simulations of 2 nanofluidic systems coupled through an electronic circuit to emulate the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron
model.
