This folder contains codes for the simulation of an artificial neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

input_bd contains the LAMMPS code for simulating two 2D nano channels coupled through an exterior electronic circuit, with parameters used to obtain Fig. 4C.

Efield.txt and time.txt are example ouput files (containing values of capacitor voltage and time, respectively).
